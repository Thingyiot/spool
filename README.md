### Running the App ###

After you install [git](http://git-scm.com/) and pull down the source you can run the app by typing the following in a terminal or shell session:

```bash
$ cd contracts
$ npm install -g gulp
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install & bower install
$ gulp
```
The previous commands installed [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) dependencies globally, then installs the application's dependencies using the [package.json](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html) and [bower.json](http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/#bowerjson) files located in the project's root directory.  If everything installed correctly, you should eventually see the app spin up and a browser window open to the main page of the application.
